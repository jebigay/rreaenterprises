Suddenly found my monitor having no display at all despite many attempts to TS (lowkey panicking because I'm working from home that day and it's just a few hours before my shift starts), reached out to Sir Rudy for the first time for his help, and he fixed my PC and explained the reason behind the issue. Thank you po! 👏👏👏.",
